# IPA-enrolled client in Docker

This repository contains the Dockerfile and associated assets for
building a Docker image from the official yum repo which can then be
easily IPA-enrolled to FreeIPA server in another container.

To build the image, run in the root of the repository:

    docker build -t freeipa-client .

To run the client, link it to the freeipa-server container:

    docker run --privileged --link freeipa-server-container:ipa -e PASSWORD=Secret123 -ti freeipa-client

The first time this container runs, it invokes `ipa-client-install`
with the given admin password and configures itself against
the FreeIPA server in the ipa-aliased container. The alias is set
with the `--link` option.  The referenced server container must be
running.

The `-ti` parameters are optional and are used for get a terminal
(useful for experimenting in the container).

The container can the be stopped and started:

    docker stop <the-container-id>
    docker start -ai <the-container-id>

# FreeIPA server in Docker

Checkout the `fedora-20`, `fedora-rawhide`, or `rhel-7` branch,
to get repository with the Dockerfile and associated assets for
building a FreeIPA/IdM server Docker image from the official yum
repo.

# Automated builds

From fedora-* branches in https://github.com/adelton/docker-freeipa,
images are automatically built into https://hub.docker.com/u/adelton/.
